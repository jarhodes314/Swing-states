# Swing states
*Shoot, swing and slice, just don't hit anything!*

Swing off the ceiling and blocks! But don't collide or go off-screen!

 - Left mouse button - launch grapple
 - Hold left mouse - retract grapple
 - Slice the cursor through the rope to cut it.

Made by Henry and James using LOVE 2D.

For a 10 hour game jam, for which the theme was "One-Button".
